This is a simple Blender 2.8+ Addon to export meshes as code that is
compatible with fysiks.
Simply install it in Blender and it should work.
Export by selecting the mesh you want to export and go to
`File > Export > Fysiks (.lua)`

Make sure your mesh is convex or it will not work properly with fysiks!
Split any concave meshes into convex parts and export them separately!
